# Brotato_Mod_Selector
This is a simple Powershell script that allows you to select a mod pck file and then launches the game with the selected pck file. The game is launched through Steam, and passes launch options to use the selected pck file as the main pack. This method does not require any files to be copied to or modified in the game directory.

Due to the way it is written and the dependency on Steam, this script is currently only compatible with the Steam version of Brotato running on a version of Windows that has Powershell. This is likely limited to Windows 7 SP1 or greater (unverified), Windows 10, and Windows 11. Actual milage may vary.
